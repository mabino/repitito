# Repitito - The Little Key Repeater

Repitito is a Windows desktop application that captures keyboard input and replays it on demand. It is built with WPF on .NET 9 and comes with a lightweight test harness to guard the SendInput interop layer and the playback planner.

## Features

- **Record & Playback** – Capture keystrokes with timing metadata and replay them deterministically.
- **Global Hotkey** – Use `F8` anywhere to toggle playback, even when the main window is not focused.
- **Lowercase Preservation** – Recorded characters keep their original glyphs (including lowercase) through playback.
- **Loop Playback** – Continuously repeat recorded sequences (enabled by default) with a single checkbox toggle.
- **Inline Editing** – Double-click delay or key cells to edit them in place with validation for key names and recorded characters.
- **Drag Reordering** – Use the handle column to drag rows and reorder the playback sequence on the fly.
- **Playback Controls** – Configure randomization, minimum delay, speed multiplier, and variance jitter.
- **Diagnostics & Tests** – Native SendInput wrappers include guarded fallbacks with extensive unit tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- .NET 9 SDK

### Building

```pwsh
# Restore and build the solution
 dotnet build KeyPlaybackSuite.sln
```

### Running the App

```pwsh
# Launch the WPF application
 dotnet run --project KeyPlaybackApp/KeyPlaybackApp.csproj
```

### Running Tests

The solution includes a custom console-based test runner. Execute it via:

```pwsh
# Run unit tests
 dotnet run --project KeyPlaybackApp.Tests/KeyPlaybackApp.Tests.csproj
```

### Automation Scripts

The `scripts/` directory provides convenience wrappers for common tasks:

- `scripts/build.ps1` – restores and builds the entire solution (accepts `-Configuration`).
- `scripts/test.ps1` – runs the console-based test harness.
- `scripts/run.ps1` – launches the WPF application, optionally skipping restore with `-NoRestore`.
- `scripts/package.ps1` – publishes distributable binaries (self-contained single file by default, configurable via `-FrameworkDependent` or `-DisableSingleFile`).
- `scripts/generate-icon.ps1` – renders the 🎹 glyph into multi-resolution PNGs and bundles them into `KeyPlaybackApp/Assets/Icons/Repitito.ico`.

### Previewing the Docs Site with Docker

To build or live-serve the Jekyll site locally without installing Ruby, use the provided Docker configuration:

```pwsh
docker compose up --build
```

This will install the required gems inside the container, watch `docs/`, and expose the site at `http://localhost:4000` (LiveReload on `35729`). Stop with `Ctrl+C` when you're done.

Run them with PowerShell from the repository root, for example:

```pwsh
pwsh -File scripts/package.ps1 -Configuration Release -Runtime win-x64
```

## Project Structure

- `KeyPlaybackApp/` – WPF application (uses namespaces under `Repitito.*`).
  - `Core/` – Playback planner, randomization interfaces, and domain records.
  - `Services/` – Native keyboard interop, global hotkey management, playback services.
  - `MainWindow.xaml` – UI layer for recording and playback controls.
- `KeyPlaybackApp.Tests/` – Console test harness covering planner logic and interop fallbacks.
- `KeyPlaybackSuite.sln` – Solution file referencing the app and test projects.
- `docs/` – Cute GitHub Pages site (select `docs/` as the Pages source to publish it).

## Hotkey Reference

- `F8` – Start playback if idle, stop playback if running, or dismiss recording mode.
